# CPRScout-Stronghold
FRC Team 3663 - Stronghold Scouting App. 
This is an Android app designed for the 2016 FRC Stronghold game to be used on Android 4.1 and above.  This was created during the summer of 2016 as a tool to self-teach Android Studio and was not used during competition.  It is fully functional and saves data on an android phone or tablet in CSV format in the /sdcard/data/CPR_Scout directory.  The intent is to then import the data into Excel and Tableau for further processing.  This app closely replicates the paper form that was used during the competition season for FRC team 3663 - Cedar Park Robotics.
